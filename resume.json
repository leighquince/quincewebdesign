        "summary": "I was previously a teacher of ICT and Computing for 5 years located in London. I am now a web developer working in Switzerland. My main responsibility is leading the design, development and testing of our front-end products, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, require.js, Backbone/Marionette and JQuery to produce feature rich single page applications. In development I also make use of Mockjax to allow for a front-end first approach when developing. Tools such as Grunt help turning the development code into production ready code. In addition to my front-end responsibilities I am also working on our back-end, using Java, Spring and Hibernate to create our services, testing all development using JUnit and Mockito. I have also had the chance to develop for Android, creating an app to support one of our services using the android development studio. In my spare time, depending on the time of the year, I can either be found on the mountain skiing or in the lake canoeing.",
